She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh. She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh.
She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeeeh!

You think you lost your love, when I saw her yesterday.
It's you she's thinking of, and she told me what to say.
She says she loves you, and you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She said you hurt her so, she almost lost her mind.
And now she says she knows, you're not the hurting kind.
She says she loves you, and you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh! She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh!
And with a love like that, you know you should be glad.

And now it's up to you, I think it's only fair,
if I should hurt you too, apologize to her,
because she loves you, and you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh! She loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh!
And with a love like that, you know you should be glad.
And with a love like that, you know you should be glad.
And with a love like that, you know you shouuuld be glad.
Yeh, yeh, yeh; yeh, yeh, yeh; yeh, yeh, yeeeh!
